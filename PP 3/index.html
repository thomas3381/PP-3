            <h2>What is PayPal?</h2>
            <p>PayPal is an online payment platform that allows users to make payments, transfer money, and receive funds securely. With over 400 million active users globally, PayPal is a trusted and popular choice for online transactions. It supports transactions in multiple currencies, and is widely accepted by online retailers and marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, and Amazon.</p>

            <h3>How Does PayPal Work?</h3>
            <p>To use PayPal, you first need to create an account. There are two types of accounts: Personal and Business. A Personal account is suitable for most users who just want to send and receive money, while a Business account is tailored for merchants and online stores.</p>

            <h3>Creating a PayPal Account</h3>
            <p>1. Visit <a href="https://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">www.paypal.com</a></p>
            <p>2. Click "Sign Up" and choose either a Personal or Business account.</p>
            <p>3. Fill in your personal information (name, email, address) and create a password.</p>
            <p>4. Link a payment method (bank account, debit/credit card) to your PayPal account.</p>
            <p>5. Verify your email and you're all set!</p>

            <h3>Making a Payment with PayPal</h3>
            <p>Making payments with PayPal is simple and secure. When you make a purchase from a website that supports PayPal, you just need to select PayPal as your payment method. Log into your PayPal account, confirm the payment, and the transaction will be completed instantly.</p>

            <h3>Receiving Payments with PayPal</h3>
            <p>If you're selling goods or services, you can receive payments via PayPal. Simply provide the buyer with your PayPal email address, and the payment will be deposited directly into your PayPal account. From there, you can withdraw funds to your bank account or use PayPal's debit card for purchases.</p>

            <h2>Common PayPal Issues & How to Resolve Them</h2>
            <p>Even though PayPal is generally reliable, there are some issues that users may encounter. Below are common problems and solutions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Limitations:</strong> PayPal may limit access to your account if it detects unusual activity. If this happens, follow the instructions in the Resolution Center to lift the limitation. PayPal may ask you to provide additional information or documents.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Payment Failures:</strong> If you're trying to make a payment but it fails, it could be due to insufficient funds, a blocked card, or issues with PayPal’s servers. Check the payment method linked to your account, ensure there are no restrictions, and try again.</li>

                <li><strong>Disputes and Chargebacks:</strong> PayPal offers protection for both buyers and sellers. If there's an issue with a transaction, you can file a dispute through the Resolution Center. If the dispute isn't resolved, you can escalate it to a claim.</li>

                <li><strong>Refund Delays:</strong> If you're waiting for a refund and it's taking longer than expected, check your PayPal account and make sure the transaction was processed correctly. Refunds usually take 5-7 business days to be reflected on your account.</li>
            </ul>
